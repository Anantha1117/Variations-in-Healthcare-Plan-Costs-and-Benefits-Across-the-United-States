# Variations-in-Healthcare-Plan-Costs-and-Benefits-Across-the-United-States
The project examines how healthcare plan costs and benefits vary across different U.S. states, considering factors such as plan type (PPO, HMO), metal levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum), and regional affordability.

Dataset: Sourced from data.healthcare.gov, the dataset includes 60,345 records and 151 variables, covering premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and co-insurance rates.

Key Research Questions:
How do plan types and metal levels impact insurance rates?
What are the state-wise variations in plan availability and cost?
Can predictive models forecast premium costs based on plan benefits and geography?
What policy recommendations can improve healthcare affordability and accessibility?
How do state laws and income levels influence plan selection?
What is the impact of provider network size on healthcare costs?

Significance:
Findings will help insurers optimize plans, assist consumers in making informed choices, and support policymakers in reducing geographic disparities in healthcare affordability.
